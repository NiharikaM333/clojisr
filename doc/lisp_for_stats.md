## Lisp for Statistical Computing

Along the years, there have been many calls and attempts to use Lisp dialects for statistics.

That is a long story. Till we write a good summary of it, here are some historical examples worth looking into.
* [Lisp-Stat, XLispStat](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~luke/xls/xlsinfo/) by L. Tierney and some [projetcs](https://github.com/blindglobe/common-lisp-stat) continuing them
* [Lush](http://lush.sourceforge.net/) by Y. LeCun
* [This](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/Compstat-2008.pdf) influencial 2008 paper by R. Ihaka (one of R's inventors) and D.T. Lang
* [This](https://panicz.github.io/pamphlet/) 2019 pamphlet by R.M. Godek
