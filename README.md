Clojure speaks statistics - a library for Clojure-R interop

[This README is being intensivey edited these days.]

## Scope of the project

There are already stable libraries for Clojure-R interop -- see [this list](doc/existing_libraries.md).

This project suggests yet another way to use R from Clojure. At the moment, everything is alpha, and will keep changing.

Currently we target only JVM Clojure, but we are interested in generalizing the work to Clojurescript.

The related problem, of calling Cojure from R, may be addressed too in the future. We are experimenting with that.

## Why this name?

Clojure Speaks Statistics is a homage to [Emacs Speaks Statistics](https://ess.r-project.org).

## Goals

  * experiment with function-centric API  (status: a draft exists, it will change)

  * experiment with syntax -- e.g., using and extending the EDN-based syntax inroducted in [gg4clj](https://github.com/JonyEpsilon/gg4clj) and [used](https://github.com/sbelak/huri/blob/master/src/huri/plot.clj#L299) in [huri](https://github.com/sbelak/huri) (status: not here yet)

  * support interop with minimal copying of data (status: supported)

  * achieve compatibility with common data abstractions such as [tech.ml.dataset](https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset) (status: partial support) 

  * create convenient wrappers for common use cases -- e.g., data visualization (status: planning to add something soon)
 
  * abstract over additional runtimes (Renjin, FastR) (status: not there yet; planning to look into Renjin in the near future)

  * provide some convenience around multi-session support (status: a draft exists, needs some polish)



## Requirements

* [R](https://www.r-project.org)

* The [Rserve](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rserve/index.html) R package (`install.packages("Rserve")`)

* This project (currently changing)

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/scicloj/clojuress.svg)](https://clojars.org/scicloj/clojuress)

## Usage

See:

* [basic example](examples/basic_example.clj)

* [data visualization using rmarkdown](examples/rmarkdown_example.clj)

## API Draft
For now, see the [basic example](examples/basic_example.clj) and the [tests](test/clojuress_test.clj) of the `clojuress` namespace.

The API may still change, hopefully after some good ideas in community discussions.

## Background

1. [Lisp for statistical computing](doc/lisp_for_stats.md)

2. [Calling R from Clojure: existing libraries](doc/existing_libraries.md)

3. [R backends](doc/r_backends.md)

4. [Some of R's data abstractions](doc/r_data_abstractions.md)

5. [Clojure's counterparts of R's data abstractions](doc/clojure_counterparts.md)

## Choices of the current project

[Here](doc/choices.md) are the current priorities of the project in some central design and implementation questions.


## Future opportunities

[Here](doc/future.md) are some possible future developments we are considering.
